        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Building upon 13+ years of hands-on experience in Agile environments, I have honed my skills as a Delivery Manager and Scrum Master, consistently bridging the gap between business objectives and technical execution. My career is marked by a proven ability to transform teams, streamline deployment pipelines, and ensure product stability – as evidenced by successfully transitioning a non-agile team to Scrumban within two months and achieving zero downtime for a SaaS product over the past year.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          My domain knowledge spans diverse sectors, including e-commerce, mobile application development (particularly hybrid applications), educational systems, and vehicle inspection software. This breadth of experience allows me to quickly grasp the nuances of different business models and tailor Agile practices to specific industry needs.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          My expertise extends to translating complex business requirements into clear technical language, fostering effective communication, and driving high-quality product delivery, making me a valuable asset for senior leadership roles.
