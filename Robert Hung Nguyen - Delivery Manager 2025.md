Building upon 13+ years of hands-on experience in Agile environments, I have honed my skills as a Delivery Manager and Scrum Master, consistently bridging the gap between business objectives and technical execution. My career is marked by a proven ability to transform teams, streamline deployment pipelines, and ensure product stability, as evidenced by successfully transitioning a non-agile team to Scrumban within two months and achieving zero downtime for a SaaS product over the past year.

This breadth of experience allows me to quickly grasp the nuances of different business models and tailor agile practices to specific industry needs.
