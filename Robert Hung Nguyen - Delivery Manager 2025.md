### Claude Prompt Pack (10 Prompts) for Weekly Scrumban Workflow

**Context Note (Paste before each prompt):**

"We are running Scrumban. We do not use fixed sprint goals. Work is task-flow based. Release schedule is every Monday and Thursday. Prioritize delivery reliability, risk visibility, and cross-team coordination."

**1) Monday/Thursday Release Readiness Check**

"Act as a senior Delivery Manager assistant. Using the task list below, prepare a release readiness report for the next deployment (Monday or Thursday):
1) tasks ready for release,
2) tasks at risk,
3) blockers/dependencies,
4) rollback/prevention checklist,
5) final go/no-go recommendation with reasons. Keep it concise and actionable."

**2) Mid-Week Flow Health Review**

"Analyze this Scrumban board snapshot and identify:
1) WIP bottlenecks,
2) aging tasks,
3) throughput risks before next deployment,
4) top 3 flow improvement actions for the next 3 working days."

**3) Dependency and Escalation Planner**

"From the tasks below, detect cross-team dependencies and produce:
1) dependency map,
2) risk level (high/medium/low),
3) escalation plan with owner and deadline,
4) fallback options if dependency misses Monday/Thursday release."

**4) Executive Status Update (No Sprint Language)**

"Draft an executive weekly delivery update without using sprint terms. Structure:
1) delivered in last Monday/Thursday releases,
2) currently in progress,
3) top risks and mitigation,
4) decisions needed from leadership,
5) confidence level for next release windows."

**5) Stakeholder Communication Rewriter**

"Rewrite this delivery message in 3 versions: neutral, assertive, executive. Keep facts unchanged. Include clear ask, owner, and due date. Avoid technical jargon unless necessary."

**6) Release Scope Trade-Off Advisor**

"Given limited capacity for the next Monday/Thursday deployment, prioritize tasks using business impact, risk, dependency, and effort. Return:
1) include now,
2) defer,
3) must-discuss trade-offs,
4) impact of each option."

**7) Incident and Stability Review**

"Based on recent incidents and deployment notes, generate:
1) recurring failure patterns,
2) probable root causes,
3) preventive actions before next release,
4) owner-by-owner action list with target date."

**8) Team Action Plan for Next 7 Days**

"Create a 7-day execution plan aligned to Monday/Thursday releases. Include:
1) daily priorities,
2) dependency checkpoints,
3) risk review moments,
4) release cut-off and QA validation points."

**9) Interview/CV Evidence Converter**

"Convert these raw delivery achievements into quantified STAR bullets for Senior Delivery Manager interviews. Focus on flow efficiency, release reliability, cross-team leadership, and stakeholder impact (no P&L claims)."

**10) Monthly Leadership Reflection**

"Review my monthly notes and generate:
1) key leadership wins,
2) missed opportunities,
3) capability gaps to improve,
4) 30-day learning and execution plan,
5) 3 measurable commitments for next month."
